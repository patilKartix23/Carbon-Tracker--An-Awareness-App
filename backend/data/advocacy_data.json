The climate disaster deeply affected her, and she decided to take action in an extraordinary way.\n\nIn 2017, at age 11, Ridhima filed a petition with the National Green Tribunal against the Indian government for failure to take adequate action on climate change. Her legal case argued that the government's inaction violated her fundamental rights to life, clean environment, and intergenerational equity.\n\n\"I saw people dying because of floods and droughts,\" Ridhima says. \"I felt angry that adults were not doing enough to protect our future. So I decided to speak up.\"\n\nRidhima's case was inspired by the success of youth climate lawsuits globally, particularly the Juliana v. United States case. She became the youngest climate activist in India to file such a petition.\n\nNow 16, Ridhima continues her activism through school programs, social media campaigns, and speaking at international forums. She's part of the global youth climate movement alongside Greta Thunberg and other young activists.\n\n\"The climate crisis is our crisis,\" she emphasizes. \"Young people must lead because we're the ones who will face the worst impacts. We don't have time to wait for others to fix this.\"\n\nRidhima's courage has inspired thousands of Indian students to join climate strikes and demand climate action from their government. Her message is clear: age is no barrier to making a difference.",

When logging trucks arrived to cut down 400-year-old deodar trees for a highway project, 200 women formed a human chain around the forest.\n\nThey were reenacting the legendary Chipko Movement of the 1970s, where villagers—mostly women—literally hugged trees to prevent their felling.\n\n\"Our ancestors protected these forests,\" says Kamla Devi, 62, one of the movement leaders. \"These trees give us water, prevent landslides, and are our children's inheritance. We won't let them be destroyed for a road that benefits politicians, not us.\"\n\nThe modern Chipko protesters used a mix of traditional non-violent resistance and social media savvy. Videos of women hugging trees went viral, gaining 10 million views. Environmental lawyers joined the cause, filing stay orders. Climate activists from across India traveled to Kinnaur in solidarity.\n\nThe protest lasted 47 days. Finally, in April 2025, the High Court ruled in favor of the villagers. The highway project was rerouted to avoid the forest, and 400 hectares of old-growth forest was designated as a protected area.\n\nKey achievements:\n• 400 hectares of ancient forest protected permanently\n• Alternative highway route approved that preserves ecology\n• ₹50 lakh compensation fund for village development\n• Forest rights of 12 villages legally recognized\n• Tourism plan developed for sustainable livelihood\n\n\"This is not just about trees,\" Kamla explains. \"It's about our right to live in harmony with nature, about protecting our water sources, our climate, our way of life.\"\n\nThe Kinnaur victory has sparked similar movements across Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. The spirit of Chipko—peaceful resistance, community solidarity, and respect for nature—lives on in a new generation of forest defenders.",

She's a solar engineer with 'Barefoot College,' installing micro-grids in villages that have never seen electricity.\n\n6:00 AM - Morning meeting with village elders. Today's goal: Install a 50 kW solar micro-grid that will power 150 homes, a school, and a health clinic.\n\n7:00 AM - The team begins unloading solar panels from trucks. Each panel weighs 20kg. In remote areas with no roads, panels are sometimes carried by mule or even on foot.\n\n9:00 AM - Local villagers join the installation. Priya trains them as she works. \"I don't want to just install and leave,\" she explains. \"I want villages to be self-sufficient, to maintain and repair their own systems.\"\n\n12:00 PM - Lunch break. Simple dal-roti cooked by village women who are learning to become solar entrepreneurs themselves. \"When women control energy, everything changes,\" Priya says. \"They start businesses, children study at night, healthcare improves.\"\n\n2:00 PM - Troubleshooting a tricky connection. The village's electrical demand is higher than initial estimates. Priya redesigns the system layout on the spot.\n\n4:00 PM - Teaching session. Priya shows villagers how to use multimeters, check battery health, and identify common faults. Two village women take detailed notes—they'll become the local solar technicians.\n\n6:00 PM - The moment of truth. Priya flips the main switch. For the first time in 75 years since independence, electric lights glow in every home. Children cheer. Elderly villagers have tears in their eyes.\n\n\"I've brought electricity to 87 villages so far,\" Priya reflects. \"Each village electrification feels like a small revolution. Solar power doesn't just bring light—it brings dignity, opportunity, and hope.\"\n\n7:30 PM - Priya stays for the celebration. The village has organized a small function. Children perform under electric lights for the first time. The local school announces evening classes will now be possible.\n\n9:00 PM - Back in her lodging, Priya updates project reports and plans tomorrow's installation. Next week: A village even more remote, accessible only by boat.\n\nImpact so far:\n• 87 villages electrified\n• 12,500 households with clean power\n• 200 women trained as solar entrepreneurs\n• 450 tons of CO2 emissions avoided annually\n• Zero diesel generators needed\n\n\"This is India's energy future,\" Priya says. \"Decentralized, clean, empowering. And it's happening one village at a time.\"",

      "story_type": "interview",
      "content": "Q: Pune just achieved carbon neutrality. How did you do it?\n\nDr. Kulkarni: It took 7 years of systematic work across five key areas: renewable energy, sustainable transport, waste management, green spaces, and citizen engagement. We started in 2018 with a comprehensive carbon audit.\n\nQ: What were the biggest challenges?\n\nDr. Kulkarni: Convincing people that climate action wouldn't hurt the economy—actually, it boosted it! We created 45,000 green jobs. Solar installation, EV manufacturing, organic waste processing—these are growth sectors. Also, changing mindsets. Indians aren't used to separating waste or using public transport. We had to make sustainable choices the easy choices.\n\nQ: Tell us about Pune's renewable energy strategy.\n\nDr. Kulkarni: We made rooftop solar mandatory for all buildings over 1000 sq meters. Subsidized it 40% for residential buildings. Today, 60% of Pune's electricity comes from solar. We also invested heavily in wind power in nearby districts. Every municipal building is now 100% solar-powered.\n\nQ: Public transport seems central to your plan.\n\nDr. Kulkarni: Absolutely. We expanded metro to 50 km, made all city buses electric, created 400 km of protected cycling lanes, and implemented congestion pricing for private vehicles in the city center. Result? Car usage dropped 35%, air quality improved dramatically.\n\nQ: What about waste management?\n\nDr. Kulkarni: Waste is a resource, not a problem. We implemented mandatory waste segregation with fines for non-compliance. Organic waste goes to biogas plants that power 20,000 homes. Recyclables create local jobs. Only 5% now goes to landfills, down from 80% in 2018.\n\nQ: How did you increase green cover in a dense city?\n\nDr. Kulkarni: Vertical forests on buildings, urban forests in every ward, protection of existing tree cover, green corridors connecting parks. We planted 2 million trees and created wetlands that prevent flooding while cooling the city. Green cover increased from 25% to 42%.\n\nQ: What's your advice for other Indian cities?\n\nDr. Kulkarni: Start with data—know your emissions sources. Get citizens involved—this is their fight too. Think long-term—climate action is a marathon, not a sprint. And most importantly, climate action and development aren't opposites. The greenest city can also be the most prosperous.\n\nQ: What's next for Pune?\n\nDr. Kulkarni: Carbon neutral is just the start. Now we're aiming to become carbon negative by 2030—actually removing more CO2 than we emit. We're expanding urban forests, exploring carbon capture technology, and working with surrounding districts on regional climate solutions.\n\nKey Achievements:\n• 100% renewable electricity\n• 35% reduction in private vehicle use\n• 95% waste diversion from landfills\n• 42% green cover (up from 25%)\n• 45,000 green jobs created\n• Air quality improved 60%\n• Carbon neutral status achieved 2025\n\n\"Pune proved that Indian cities can lead on climate while improving quality of life and creating prosperity. The blueprint is here. Now we need 100 more Punes.\"",
