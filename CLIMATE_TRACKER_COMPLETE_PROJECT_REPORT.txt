     PARTITION BY time_period 
     ORDER BY total_co2_saved DESC
   )
   
   TIME PERIODS:
   - Weekly: Last 7 days
   - Monthly: Last 30 days
   - All-Time: Since account creation
   
   TREND CALCULATION:
   Trend = (Current_Week_Savings - Last_Week_Savings) / Last_Week_Savings
   
   Trend Categories:

   - Monthly Master: 30 consecutive days active
   - Eco Warrior: Total CO2 saved > 100 kg
   - Climate Champion: Total CO2 saved > 500 kg
   - Consistency King: 30-day streak maintained
   
   ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCK LOGIC:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. ADVOCACY PLATFORM ALGORITHMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 PETITION TRENDING ALGORITHM
   
   PURPOSE: Surface most relevant and urgent petitions to users
   
   TRENDING SCORE FORMULA:
   Score = (Signatures_Per_Day × Progress_Boost × Deadline_Boost)
   
   Component Calculations:
   
   a) Signatures Per Day:
      = Current_Signatures / Days_Since_Creation
   
   b) Progress Boost:
      Progress = Current_Signatures / Goal_Signatures
      Boost = 1 + (Progress × 0.5)
      Amplifies petitions nearing their goal
   
   c) Deadline Boost:
      IF Days_Until_Deadline ≤ 7:
        Boost = 2.0 (urgent deadline)
      ELIF 7 < Days_Until_Deadline ≤ 30:
        Boost = 1.5 (approaching deadline)
      ELSE:
        Boost = 1.0 (normal priority)
   
   RANKING:
   Petitions sorted by Score DESC, giving prominence to:
   - High momentum campaigns (rapid signature growth)
   - Nearly successful petitions (close to goal)
   - Time-sensitive issues (deadline approaching)

4.2 GEOGRAPHIC RELEVANCE ALGORITHM
   
   PURPOSE: Show locally relevant petitions to users
   
   HAVERSINE DISTANCE FORMULA:
   Used to calculate distance between user and petition locations
   
   a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1) × cos(lat2) × sin²(Δlon/2)
   c = 2 × atan2(√a, √(1−a))
   distance = Earth_Radius × c  (Earth_Radius = 6,371 km)
   
   RELEVANCE SCORING:
   IF distance < 50 km: Relevance = 1.0 (local)
   ELIF distance < 200 km: Relevance = 0.7 (regional)
   ELIF distance < 500 km: Relevance = 0.4 (state-level)
   ELSE: Relevance = 0.2 (national/global)
   
   FINAL SORT:
   Combined_Score = Trending_Score × Relevance_Score

4.3 IMPACT STORY POPULARITY ALGORITHM
   
   POPULARITY FORMULA:
   Popularity = (Views × 0.3) + (Likes × 0.5) + (Shares × 0.2)
   
   Weighting Rationale:
   - Likes (50%): Strong engagement indicator
   - Views (30%): Reach and awareness
   - Shares (20%): Viral potential and impact
   
   TIME DECAY:
   Recency_Factor = exp(-Days_Since_Publish / 30)
   Adjusted_Popularity = Popularity × Recency_Factor
   
   Keeps content fresh while valuing evergreen impact stories

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Score = (Capacity_Match × 0.4) + (Distance_Score × 0.3) + 
           (Geological_Stability × 0.2) + (Cost_Factor × 0.1)
   
   Where:
   - Capacity_Match = MIN(Site_Capacity / Required_Capacity, 1.0)
   - Distance_Score = 1 - (Distance / 1000 km)
   - Geological_Stability = Assessed score (0.7-1.0)
   - Cost_Factor = 1 - (Injection_Cost / Max_Acceptable_Cost)

      - Energy Costs: ₹800-1,200/tonne CO2
      - Maintenance: 5% of CAPEX annually
      - Monitoring: ₹200-400/tonne CO2
   
   NPV (Net Present Value):
   NPV = Σ [(Revenue_t - Cost_t) / (1 + Discount_Rate)^t]
   
   Payback Period:
   Years = CAPEX / (Annual_Revenue - Annual_OPEX)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SEARCH AND FILTERING ALGORITHMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 FULL-TEXT SEARCH ALGORITHM
   
   APPROACH: SQL ILIKE with Wildcard Matching

   RELEVANCE RANKING:
   1. Exact match in title: Score = 1.0
   2. Partial match in title: Score = 0.7
   3. Match in description: Score = 0.5
   4. Match in tags: Score = 0.3
   
   OPTIMIZATION:

   - Trigram indexing for fuzzy matching
   - Stop word removal for better results

6.2 MULTI-CRITERIA FILTERING
   
   BOOLEAN FILTER COMPOSITION:
   Results = Dataset 
     .filter(criteria_1 AND criteria_2 AND ... criteria_n)
     .sort(sort_field)
     .limit(page_size)
     .offset((page - 1) × page_size)
   
   AVAILABLE FILTERS:
   - Category matching (exact or hierarchical)
   - Date range filtering
   - Numeric range filtering (emissions, price, etc.)
   - Geographic radius filtering
   - Boolean flags (verified, featured, active)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. DATA AGGREGATION ALGORITHMS

7.1 TIME-SERIES AGGREGATION
   
   PURPOSE: Generate trends and summaries over time periods
   
   ALGORITHM:
   1. Group data by time bucket (day, week, month)
   2. Apply aggregation function (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
   3. Fill missing time buckets with zero or interpolated values
   4. Calculate moving averages for smoothing
   
   MOVING AVERAGE:
   MA(t) = (Value(t) + Value(t-1) + ... + Value(t-n+1)) / n
   
   Used for:
   - 7-day carbon footprint trend
   - 30-day activity average
   - Monthly emission patterns

7.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
   
   PERCENTILE CALCULATION:
   User_Percentile = (Users_Below / Total_Users) × 100
